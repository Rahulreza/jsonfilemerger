JSON File Merger

The JSON File Merger web application allows you to merge two JSON arrays seamlessly into a single JSON array. It's designed to simplify the process of combining data from two different JSON sources, which is particularly useful in scenarios where you have datasets that need to be consolidated or compared.

How It Works:
Input JSON Data:

You have two input areas labeled "JSON 1" and "JSON 2".
Paste your JSON data into these text areas. Each JSON should be a valid array of objects.
Merge Process:

Click on the "Merge JSON" button after entering JSON data.
The application will parse the JSON data from both input areas.
Merge Logic:

It merges the arrays based on a common identifier (id field assumed in this example).
Objects from JSON 1 are matched with corresponding objects from JSON 2 using their id field.
If an object with the same id exists in both JSON arrays, their properties are merged into a single object.
Output:

The merged JSON array is displayed in the "Merged JSON" section.
Each object in the merged array contains properties from both JSON arrays, ensuring comprehensive data integration.
How to Use It:
Prepare Your JSON Data:

Ensure both JSON datasets are correctly formatted before pasting them into the input fields.
Each JSON should be an array of objects with identifiable fields for merging (e.g., id).
Paste JSON Data:

Paste the first JSON dataset into the "JSON 1" text area.
Paste the second JSON dataset into the "JSON 2" text area.
Merge JSON:

Click on the "Merge JSON" button.
The application will validate and merge the JSON datasets based on the id field or any identifier specified in your implementation.
Review Merged JSON:

After merging, the resulting JSON array will be displayed in the "Merged JSON" section.
Review the merged data to ensure it meets your expectations and requirements.
Adjustments:

If there are errors or discrepancies, check the JSON data for formatting issues or ensure that the id field (or your chosen identifier) is correctly used for matching.
Example Usage:
Scenario: Merging customer data from two different databases into a single unified dataset.
Benefit: Consolidating product listings from multiple suppliers into a comprehensive inventory list.
Application: Integrating user preferences and settings from different sessions into a unified user profile.
The JSON File Merger simplifies the process of merging JSON datasets, making it a valuable tool for developers, data analysts, and anyone working with JSON data integration tasks.
